# Architecture Patterns — Production Reference

Patterns that top engineering teams actually ship. Start simple, add patterns when pain forces you to.

---

## 1. Holonomic Systems (Sistema Holonômico)

Based on Arthur Koestler's concept of the **holon** — an entity that is simultaneously a complete WHOLE and a PART of something larger. Applied to software by the SCS (Self-Contained Systems) architecture.

### The Janus Effect (dual nature)
Every component exhibits two simultaneous tendencies:
- **Self-assertive**: preserves autonomy (own data, own UI, own deploy)
- **Integrative**: cooperates as part of the larger system (events, contracts)

When the balance breaks:
- **Suppressed autonomy** (monolith) → components are just parts, no independence, failure propagates
- **Suppressed integration** (bad microservices) → nominal autonomy but chaotic coupling, distributed monolith

### Anatomy of a Software Holon
```
PUBLIC INTERFACE (REST/GraphQL, Kafka events)
     |
DOMAIN LOGIC (business rules, workflows)
     |
PERSISTENCE (own database + replicas of external data)
     |
SELF-REGULATION (health checks, circuit breakers, metrics)
```

### Rules
- Holons do NOT import other holons directly — communication via events only
- No synchronous calls between holons in the request/response cycle
- Each holon is a vertical slice: UI + logic + data
- One team per holon (Conway's Law alignment)
- Data replication via event-based updates (eventual consistency)

### Self-Contained Systems (SCS) — practical implementation

| Principle | Rule |
|---|---|
| Autonomous | Complete web application |
| Vertical slice | UI + logic + own data |
| No sync in request/response | Cannot call other SCS synchronously |
| Single team ownership | One team per SCS |
| 5-25 systems | Coarser than microservices |

### SCS vs Microservices

| Aspect | SCS/Holonomic | Microservices |
|---|---|---|
| Quantity | 5-25 | 50-500+ |
| UI | Mandatory (full vertical) | Optional |
| Granularity | Business domain | More granular/atomized |
| Sync in request | Prohibited | Allowed |

### Async Communication Challenges
- **Event ordering**: Kafka guarantees order per partition
- **Duplication**: Mandatory idempotency checks (at-least-once delivery)
- **Eventual consistency**: Accept as operational reality; UI state indicators
- **Distributed debugging**: Correlation IDs across all logs + Jaeger/Zipkin

### Evolution Path
```
Modular Monolith → Separate Schemas → Introduce Messaging → Holonomic System
```
Evolve when the pain justifies it, not prematurely.

### When to use / avoid

| Use when | Avoid when |
|---|---|
| Multiple distinct domains | Small system, single team |
| Teams need independence | MVP or proof of concept |
| High availability critical | Strong consistency is hard requirement |
| Differentiated scaling per domain | Team lacks distributed systems experience |

## 2. Architectural Styles

### Modular Monolith
Single deployable, modules with explicit boundaries, each owning domain + data + API surface. Communication through events or defined APIs. **The recommended starting point before microservices.**
- Shopify runs thousands of engineers on a modular monolith
- Modules can be extracted to services later when the need is proven
- Requires discipline to maintain boundaries (no reaching into another module's DB)

### Hexagonal / Ports & Adapters
Core business logic in the center, zero framework dependencies. Defines ports (interfaces), adapters implement them for specific tech. Core never imports an ORM, framework, or SDK.
```
[HTTP Adapter] → [Port: InputPort] → [Domain Core] → [Port: OutputPort] → [Postgres Adapter]
```
- Extremely testable (inject fakes at port level)
- Framework-agnostic, infrastructure swappable

### Vertical Slice Architecture
Organize by feature, not by layer. Each slice: endpoint + handler + validation + data access.
```
Features/
  CreateOrder/    ← everything for this feature in one place
  GetOrderById/
  CancelOrder/
```
- Eliminates cross-cutting "shotgun surgery"
- Each feature independently deployable or deletable
- Intentional code duplication across slices

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
Separate write model (commands) from read model (queries). Each scales independently.
```
[Command] → [Write Handler] → [Write DB (normalized)]
                                    |  (event/sync)
[Query]  → [Query Handler]  → [Read DB (denormalized, optimized)]
```
- Netflix uses for 260M+ subscribers
- Unlocks read models tailored to specific UI needs
- Only when read/write patterns diverge significantly

### Event Sourcing
Store every state change as immutable event. Current state = replay of events.
```
[Command] → [Aggregate] → [Event Store (append-only)] → [Projections] → [Read DB, Search, Analytics]
```
- Perfect audit trail, time-travel debugging
- Uber uses at petabyte scale (Kafka + Flink)
- Event schema evolution is hard — version events forever
- Needs snapshots for performance

## 3. Resilience Patterns

### Circuit Breaker
Monitors calls to downstream service. After failure threshold → opens circuit → rejects calls for cooldown → half-open (test calls) → close if recovered.
- Prevents cascading failure and thread pool exhaustion
- Use on every network call to external dependency
- Tune carefully: too sensitive = false trips, too lenient = delayed protection

### Bulkhead
Isolates resource pools per dependency. Slow payment service can't starve inventory queries.
```
[Service]
  |-- Pool A (50 threads) → Payment Service
  |-- Pool B (30 threads) → Inventory Service
  |-- Pool C (20 threads) → Auth Service
```

### Retry with Exponential Backoff + Jitter
```typescript
// AWS-recommended decorrelated jitter
const delay = Math.min(maxDelay,
  Math.random() * (lastDelay * 3 - baseDelay) + baseDelay
)
```
- Only for idempotent, transient failures
- Never retry deterministic errors (400 Bad Request)
- Without jitter → thundering herd

### Saga Pattern
Sequence of local transactions across services. Each step has a compensating action (rollback).
```
1. createOrder()      | compensate: cancelOrder()
2. chargePayment()    | compensate: refundPayment()
3. reserveStock()     | compensate: releaseStock()
If step 3 fails → refundPayment() → cancelOrder()
```
- **Choreography** (events, no coordinator): max 4-5 steps
- **Orchestration** (central coordinator): for complex flows
- Compensating actions are the hardest part

### Transactional Outbox
Write event to outbox table in the SAME transaction as business data. Relay publishes to Kafka later.
```sql
BEGIN;
  UPDATE orders SET status = 'confirmed';
  INSERT INTO outbox (event_type, payload) VALUES ('OrderConfirmed', '{...}');
COMMIT;
-- Debezium CDC reads WAL → publishes to Kafka
```
- Solves the dual-write problem (most dangerous consistency issue in distributed systems)
- SeatGeek uses in production

### Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)
Captures messages that failed all retries. **Every production queue needs one.**
- Store metadata: original topic, error stack, timestamp, retry count
- Alert on DLQ depth and message age
- Build tooling for inspection and reprocessing

---

## 4. Migration / Evolution Patterns

### Strangler Fig (Martin Fowler, 2004)
Proxy routes traffic between legacy and new system. Migrate piece by piece.
```
[Client] → [Facade/Proxy]
              |         |
        [New Service] [Legacy] ← routes shrink over time
```
**Steps**: Introduce proxy → Identify boundaries (DDD) → Build new service + ACL → Route + validate → Repeat → Decommission legacy

**Anti-patterns**: eternal transition (no sunset plan), premature decomposition, ignoring data migration, insufficient monitoring

### Branch by Abstraction
For deeply embedded internal components (not perimeter-routable):
```
1. Create abstraction (interface) over old implementation
2. Refactor callers to use abstraction
3. Build new implementation behind same abstraction
4. Switch via feature flag
5. Remove old implementation
```

### Parallel Run
Both systems process every request simultaneously. Compare results in shadow mode.
- GitHub's "Scientist" library
- For mission-critical paths (financial calculations, pricing)
- Doubles infrastructure cost during parallel period

### Feature Flags
Runtime toggles decoupling deploy from release.
- Percentage-based rollouts (1% → 10% → 50% → 100%)
- Kill switches for instant rollback
- LaunchDarkly serves 4 billion flags/day
- **Clean up old flags** — flag debt is real

### How they work together

| Pattern | Operates at | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| Strangler Fig | Network/proxy | Well-isolated functionality via API |
| Branch by Abstraction | Code level | Deeply embedded internal components |
| Parallel Run | Validation | Mission-critical correctness verification |
| Feature Flags | Control | Gradual rollout + instant rollback |
| Anti-Corruption Layer | Data/interface | Preventing legacy concepts leaking into new code |

In practice, mature migrations use ALL of these together.

## 5. API Patterns

### BFF (Backend for Frontend)
Dedicated backend per client type (web, mobile, TV). Netflix pioneered.
- Each client gets exactly the data it needs
- Teams iterate independently
- Skip if single client type or GraphQL covers all needs

### API Gateway
Single entry point: auth, rate limiting, TLS, routing, caching, observability.
- Must be horizontally scalable (single point of failure risk)
- Keep thin — no business logic
- Kong, AWS API Gateway, Envoy

### API Versioning (Stripe model)
Twice-yearly major releases + monthly minor releases. Internal compatibility layer transforms old requests.
```
[Client v2024-04] → [Gateway] → [Compat Layer] → [Latest Code]
```

### GraphQL Federation
Each service owns a subgraph; gateway composes the unified supergraph.
- Independent team ownership of schema segments
- Unified API for consumers
- Apollo Router is the standard gateway

## 6. Modern Frontend/Edge Patterns

### Server Components (RSC)
Components execute on server, send HTML (zero JS). Can access DB directly.
- Data-heavy pages where most content is non-interactive
- Dramatically reduces JS bundle

### Islands Architecture
Static HTML page, only interactive "islands" hydrated with JS.
- Astro is the primary framework
- Best performance scores for content-heavy sites

### Micro-Frontends
Frontend split into independently deployed pieces per team.
- Module Federation (Webpack/Vite), runtime loading, or edge stitching
- Only for large organizations where monolithic frontend is the bottleneck

### Edge Computing
Logic at CDN edge nodes (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge Functions).
- Auth validation, personalization, caching, SSR at the edge
- Single-digit ms latency
- Limited runtime (no full Node.js, execution time limits)

---

## 7. Decision Framework

### Start here (almost always)
- Modular Monolith + Feature Flags + Circuit Breakers + Outbox Pattern
- Covers 90% of production needs

### Add when pain forces you
| Pain | Pattern |
|---|---|
| Read/write workloads diverge | CQRS |
| Need audit trail / time-travel | Event Sourcing |
| Multiple distinct business domains with independent teams | Holonomic Systems / SCS |
| Legacy system to migrate | Strangler Fig + Branch by Abstraction |
| Distributed transactions | Saga + Outbox |
| External system integration | Anti-Corruption Layer |
| Multiple client types with different data needs | BFF |
| Latency-sensitive global users | Edge Computing |

### Evolution path
```
Monolith → Modular Monolith → SCS/Holonomic → Microservices (only if truly needed)
```
