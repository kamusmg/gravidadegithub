description: >
  Deep multi-agent codebase analysis with personality-driven perspectives. Use when the user asks to analyze a repository, understand a codebase, audit code quality, assess architecture, review security, or wants a comprehensive view of any project. Triggers on phrases like "analyze this repo", "understand this codebase", "what is this project", "audit this code", "review this repo", "analyze the cloud repo", or any request to evaluate a codebase from multiple angles. Always use this skill for codebase-wide analysis, even for single-perspective requests.

# Codebase Analysis — Deep Multi-Agent with Personalities

Analyze any codebase using 15+ specialized agents, each with a distinct personality and mandate. Every agent runs deep (reads 30+ files, runs real commands, cites file:line for every claim).

## Core Principle: Evidence Before Claims

Every agent MUST:
1. Read the actual file before making any claim about it
2. Cite `file:line` for every finding
3. Run real commands (grep, wc -l, git log) for every metric
4. Distinguish between "I verified this" and "I'm inferring this"
5. If unable to verify, say "UNVERIFIED:" before the claim

## Agent Architecture

### DO NOT use `subagent_type: Explore`

Explore agents are read-only and shallow. ALL agents must be launched as default general-purpose agents with `mode: bypassPermissions` so they can:
- Run bash commands (grep, wc -l, git blame, git log)
- Read unlimited files
- Execute scripts for metrics
- Produce exact numbers, not estimates

### Two-Pass Pattern

For maximum accuracy, use two passes:

**Pass 1 — Investigation (15 agents in parallel):**
Each personality agent investigates their domain deeply. They produce a report with claims, all cited with file:line.

**Pass 2 — Fact Check (1 agent after Pass 1):**
A single Fact Checker agent reads ALL reports from Pass 1 and verifies every claim that seems questionable. It reads the actual files, runs the actual commands, and produces a corrections report.

## The 15 Personalities

Each agent gets a personality that shapes HOW they analyze, not just WHAT. The personality affects tone, priorities, and metaphors, but never compromises accuracy.

### Verification Agents (Pass 2)

#### 27. O Verificador (Fact Checker)
**Runs AFTER** all 26 investigation agents complete.
**Input:** All 26 reports.
**Process:**
1. Reads each report looking for specific claims (version numbers, file sizes, line counts, vulnerability locations)
2. Verifies each claim by reading the actual file or running the actual command
3. Produces a corrections report: "Agent X claimed Y, actual value is Z"
4. Produces a confidence score for each agent's report

**Voice:** Clinical, precise, no personality. Just facts.

## Agent Prompt Template

Each agent prompt MUST include these rules:

```
You are {PERSONALITY_NAME}. {PERSONALITY_DESCRIPTION}.

Analyze the repo at {REPO_PATH}.

MANDATORY RULES:
1. For EVERY claim, cite the exact file path and line number
2. For EVERY metric, run the actual command and report the real number
3. Read at least {MIN_FILES} files before making conclusions
4. Show actual code snippets (5-10 lines) for key findings
5. If you cannot verify something, prefix with "UNVERIFIED:"
6. Distinguish fact from inference
7. Portuguese for all text

{PERSONALITY_SPECIFIC_INSTRUCTIONS}

Output format:
## {SECTION_NAME}
### Finding: {title}
- **File:** path/to/file.ext:123
- **Evidence:** actual code or command output
- **Impact:** what this means
```

## Execution Flow

1. User says "analyze this repo" or similar
2. Detect repo path and primary language
3. Launch 26 investigation agents in parallel (all with mode: bypassPermissions)
4. As agents complete, acknowledge to user
5. When all 26 complete, launch Pass 2: Fact Checker + Devil's Advocate
6. Compile final report: all 26 analyses + corrections + counterarguments
7. Save as CODEBASE-ANALYSIS.md in the repo root

## Customization

The user can request:
- Fewer agents (minimum 5 for a useful analysis)
- More agents (add custom personalities)
- Specific focus (e.g., "only security and architecture")
- Different language (default Portuguese, can switch to English)
- Skip Pass 2 (faster but less accurate)

## Output

Final deliverable: a single markdown file with:
1. Executive summary table (agent, focus, key finding)
2. Each agent's full report (with citations)
3. Fact Checker corrections (if Pass 2 ran)
4. Consolidated recommendations (prioritized)
